A3C Cartpole Performance:

- Fastest algorithm with average training duration of 30sec
- Confidence of 95% to have action "right" between 40% and 60% in average, another sample showed 34% to 54%
- Testing results in steep improvement and clearing task within 300 episodes, although sometimes weak run close to threshold is sometimes result as well
- Running saved model from Vanilla A2C achieves high performing results, seems like multiprocessing inhibits algorithm
