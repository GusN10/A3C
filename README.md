# Intro
This repo is an exploration of [Generalized Advantage Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438) (GAE) in [Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783) (A3C), which we call GA3C. It's a fork of [this](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/pytorch-A3C) implementation of A3C.
